# 🌿 AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection Web App

A web-based application that allows users to detect plant diseases through image uploads. The app uses a trained machine learning model to identify diseases and leverages Gemini AI to generate detailed content about the prediction.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend

- Make sure you have Python and Flask installed.
- Load your trained ML model (`.h5` file) in `app.py`.

Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

### 3. Set Up the Frontend

- Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
- Add your Gemini AI API key in `index.js`.

Install dependencies and start the Node server:
```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

### 4. Launch the Application

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Upload a plant image via the web interface.
2. The backend processes the image and uses a TensorFlow model to predict the disease.
3. The prediction is sent to Gemini AI to generate informative, human-readable content.
4. The result is displayed to the user on the frontend.
